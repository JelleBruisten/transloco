## Nx 15.7 and higher with transloco-key-manager

When using nx 15.7 and higher you do not have a global `angular.json` therefore the `transloco-key-manager` cannot determine what directories your projects are in, to make this work correctly we can use:
```
npx transloco-key-manager extract --project foo
```
Note: Specifying the project when you don't have a root config is mandatory

### Nx cli / config
To get a similar like experience of extracting/finding for all projects like before 15.7, you can add the following to each `project.json` for each libary or application:
```json
"i18n-extract": {
  "executor": "nx:run-commands",
  "options": {
    "command": "npx transloco-keys-manager extract --project myProjectName"
  }
}
```


Example:
```json
{
  "name": "foo",
  "$schema": "..\\..\\node_modules\\nx\\schemas\\project-schema.json",
  "projectType": "library",
  "sourceRoot": "libs/foo",
  "prefix": "cca",
  "targets": {
    "build": { ... },
    "test": { ... },
    "lint": { ... },
    // highlight-start
    "i18n-extract": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
      "options": {
        "command": "npx transloco-keys-manager extract --project foo"
      }
    }
    // highlight-end
  }
}
```


This will allow you to use the `nx` cli to execute the `i18n-extract` target on each project that has such a target:

All projects:

`nx run-many --target=i18n-extract` 

Affected projects:

`nx affected --target=i18n-extract` 

Extra benefit of this would be that we can extract keys from only affected projects by leveraging the `nx` cli
